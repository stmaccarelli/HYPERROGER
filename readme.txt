ROGER WATER is a web-based interactive and audioreactive 360 + VR experience, created by Stefano Maccarelli for Niagara, that goes far beyond the concept of a VR or interactive music video.
It's a kind of explorative videogame.

ROGER WATER is an endless flying exploration of a generative, infinite open world made of surreal Earth-like landscapes generated and animated by the music of Roger Water by Niagara and inspired by HYPERLAND, the new Niagara AV show made by Stefano Maccarelli.
It's a kind of parallel universe connected to ours, populated by objects from modern terrestrial civilization and terrestrial creatures that behave in unusual ways.

And it's open to anyone who has a decent browser or smartphone, no need to download apps or buy expensive gear.

The landscapes are generated, animated and populated in real time, thanks to sound analysis, as the traveler explores them.
Players can travel that world with a computer or a smartphone, in 360 or VR (Cardboard) mode.

Experiencing ROGER WATER world from a computer or Android device gives players the chance to activate their microphone and let the world react to their voice, music, ambient sounds, etc.
They just need to wait for ROGER WATER music to end.

Players can fly freely in this infinite and everchanging generative open world, accelerate, fly up or down, launch objects and creatures, follow them, or just stay and contemplate it.
They also can manually populate the world by launching objects and creatures, and Cardboard mode is compatible with bluetooth VR remote controllers.

The generative world reacts also with time and location of the player, and features some secret things that players can discover by finding "special areas" or by visiting it at specific hours.

When using a smartphone or tablet, and both in 360 and VR mode, players need to physically turn and move around in order to fully explore the world; this gives them a more immersive experience.
